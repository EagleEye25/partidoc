<h2>estimatefee nblocks</h2>
<p>DEPRECATED. Please use estimatesmartfee for more intelligent estimates.
Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin
confirmation within nblocks blocks. Uses virtual transaction size of transaction
as defined in BIP 141 (witness data is discounted).</p>
<h2>Arguments:</h2>
<ol>
<li>nblocks     (numeric, required)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>n              (numeric) estimated fee-per-kilobyte</p>
<p>A negative value is returned if not enough transactions and blocks
have been observed to make an estimate.
-1 is always returned for nblocks == 1 as it is impossible to calculate
a fee that is high enough to get reliably included in the next block.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><code>particl-cli estimatefee 6</code></p>
