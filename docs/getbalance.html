<h2>getbalance ( &quot;account&quot; minconf include_watchonly )</h2>
<p>If account is not specified, returns the server's total available balance.
If account is specified (DEPRECATED), returns the balance in the account.
Note that the account &quot;&quot; is not the same as leaving the parameter out.
The server total may be different to the balance in the default &quot;&quot; account.</p>
<h2>Arguments:</h2>
<ol>
<li>&quot;account&quot;         (string, optional) DEPRECATED. The account string may be given as a
specific account name to find the balance associated with wallet keys in
a named account, or as the empty string (&quot;&quot;) to find the balance
associated with wallet keys not in any named account, or as &quot;*&quot; to find
the balance associated with all wallet keys regardless of account.
When this option is specified, it calculates the balance in a different
way than when it is not specified, and which can count spends twice when
there are conflicting pending transactions (such as those created by
the bumpfee command), temporarily resulting in low or even negative
balances. In general, account balance calculation is not considered
reliable and has resulted in confusing outcomes, so it is recommended to
avoid passing this argument.</li>
<li>minconf           (numeric, optional, default=1) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.</li>
<li>include_watchonly (bool, optional, default=false) Also include balance in watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')</li>
</ol>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>amount              (numeric) The total amount in PART received for this account.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p>The total amount in the wallet with 1 or more confirmations
<code>particl-cli getbalance</code></p>
<p>The total amount in the wallet at least 6 blocks confirmed
<code>particl-cli getbalance &quot;*&quot; 6</code></p>
